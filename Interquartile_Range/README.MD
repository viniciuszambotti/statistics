## Task
The interquartile range of an array is the difference between its first (Q1) and third (Q3) quartiles (i.e.,Q3 - Q1 ).
Given an array, X, of n integers and an array, F, representing the respective frequencies of X's elements, 
construct a data set,S, where each x1 occurs at frequency f1. Then calculate and print S's interquartile range, 
rounded to a scale of 1 decimal place (i.e.,12.3  format).
